# KS Events - Advanced Event Management System

A modern, professional event management system built with React frontend and Flask backend, featuring admin and student portals with payment integration.

## üöÄ Features

# KS Events

KS Events is a full-stack event management application built for institutions and communities to create, publish, and manage events. It includes an Admin portal for event organizers, a Student portal for attendees to browse and register, and a public-facing site for discovery.

## Key Highlights

- Admin portal with event CRUD, registration tracking and revenue reporting
- Student portal for browsing events, registering, and managing registrations
- Public interface for event discovery with search and category filters
- Simulated payment flow for paid events (can be swapped for a real gateway)
- Built with React (Vite) frontend and Flask backend with SQLAlchemy

## Features

- Dashboard and analytics for admins
- Event categories, detailed event pages, and media/image support
- Registration management with payment status
- Responsive UI and modern design

## Technology Stack

- Frontend: React 18, Vite, React Router
- Backend: Flask, Flask-CORS, SQLAlchemy
- Database: PostgreSQL (development can use SQLite)
- Dev tooling: Node.js, npm, Python 3.8+

## Quickstart (Development)

Follow these steps to run the project locally.

1) Clone the repository (if you haven't already):

```powershell
git clone https://github.com/KamalSai3/KS_Events.git
cd "KS-Events"
```

2) Backend setup

```powershell
cd backend-flask
python -m venv venv
venv\Scripts\activate   # Windows
pip install -r requirements.txt
# Configure DB connection in config.py (default uses PostgreSQL)
python init_db.py        # create or initialize the database
python app.py            # or: flask run
```

The backend will run at: http://localhost:5000

3) Frontend setup (in a separate terminal)

```powershell
cd frontend
npm install
npm run dev
```

The frontend dev server will run at: http://localhost:5173

## Configuration

- Backend settings are in `backend-flask/config.py` (database URL, CORS, secrets).
- To switch databases, update the SQLALCHEMY_DATABASE_URI.

## Deployment Notes

- Use PostgreSQL in production and set proper environment variables for DB credentials.
- Consider using a real payment gateway (Stripe/PayPal) instead of the simulated payment flow.
- Containerize with Docker for easier deployment.
